The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
This project, challanged me to create a simplified version of Cirillo's original Pomodoro technique.
This project was designed to test the ability to work with rendering and state management using React. The next learning objectives were covered:

<or>
<li> Installing packages via NPM</li>
<li> Running tests from the command line</li>
<li> Writing React function components</li>
<li> Using hooks like useState()</li>
<li> Debugging React code through console output</li>
</or>
